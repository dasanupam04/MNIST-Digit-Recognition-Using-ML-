# MNIST-Digit-Recognition-Using-ML-
This project transforms the classic MNIST dataset into a full production-style application that can recognize hand-drawn digits with high accuracy — whether uploaded as an image or drawn directly on a canvas. It goes far beyond a simple notebook: every part of the ML workflow is implemented, automated, and connected.
